### Brief

From the [Time Tracking Dashboard Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw) page on Frontend Mentor's website:

> Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
>
> You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.
>
> If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local data.json file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the .html file.
>
> Your users should be able to:
>
> - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

### FEM Provided Resources
